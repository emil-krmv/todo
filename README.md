# Simple ToDo Laravel App

This is a simple task manager.

**Main features**
- Authorize (register or log in)
- Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by different fields

## Description

I think this is not even MVP, it's a some kind of alpha/beta version.

I'll add a nicer interface soon, mb another features and some refactoring.

**I work on that by this way: read docs -> change smth**
